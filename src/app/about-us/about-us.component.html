       <p><strong>If you wish to enjoy delicious seafood creations, you don't have to travel to the coastal areas. It is enough to
        stop by us in Linz-an absolute necessity for all fish and seafood lovers.
    </strong><br>
        In 2020, a well-known gourmet guide ennobled the ROSSO restaurant in Linz with the title of “probably the best
        Italian in town”. An award that many other restaurateurs would have been satisfied with, but not our busy ROSSO
        host Ingmar Goetzloff, who is always reinventing himself and our restaurant.

        Starting out as an Italian osteria, ROSSO has evolved over time into a high-quality restaurant with a focus on
        fish and seafood. Two things were decisive for this: first, the constant gastronomic curiosity of the owner, who
        travels near the sea as often as possible to be inspired by new food creations, especially in family-run
        restaurants. And secondly, the joy with which chef Georg Materic experiments. Whenever Ingmar Goetzloff comes up
        with a new idea, he tries to implement it in such a way as to create his own ROSSO recipe: with a clear
        reference to the original dish, but refined in such a way that it will make even the most discerning palate
        rejoice.

    <p>This is how, for example, the current signature dish of ROSSO was created, with the resonant name “Loligo Alba”, meaning squid in a white bath. An appetizer originating in Veneto, a ready-to-cook squid is cut into spaghetti-like strips and served in a specially developed Franciacorta sauce. The preparation of the squid and the salsa are the results of many experiments in the ROSSO kitchen and secrets that, of course, are not revealed.</p>
